# svelte-test

I did this to see how Svelte works

## Creating a project

````bash
# create a new project in the current directory
pnpx sv create my-app

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `pnpm install`, tostart a development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
pnpm run dev -- --open
````

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
pnpm run build
```
